### **Efficient Strategies to Choose Thresholds**
1. **Midpoints Between Sorted Values:**
   - Instead of using all unique values, calculate midpoints between consecutive sorted feature values.
   - Rationale: Splits only need to occur between observed values, not at every unique value.
   - Example:
     ```python
     feature_values = np.sort(X[:, feature_idx])
     thresholds = (feature_values[:-1] + feature_values[1:]) / 2
     ```
   - This reduces the number of thresholds while still capturing meaningful splits.

2. **Quantile-Based Thresholds:**
   - Choose thresholds based on quantiles of the data distribution.
   - Example:
     ```python
     thresholds = np.percentile(X[:, feature_idx], np.linspace(0, 100, num=100))
     ```
   - This method ensures that the thresholds are spread evenly across the data range, reducing computation.

3. **Random Sampling of Thresholds:**
   - Randomly sample a subset of unique values or the data range to use as thresholds.
   - Example:
     ```python
     unique_values = np.unique(X[:, feature_idx])
     sampled_thresholds = np.random.choice(unique_values, size=100, replace=False)
     ```
   - This is especially useful when there are millions of unique values.

4. **Binning:**
   - Group the continuous variable into bins and use bin boundaries as thresholds.
   - Example using `np.histogram`:
     ```python
     _, bin_edges = np.histogram(X[:, feature_idx], bins=50)
     thresholds = bin_edges[:-1]  # Use left edges of bins
     ```

5. **Gradient-Based Selection (Advanced):**
   - In gradient-boosted algorithms (e.g., XGBoost, LightGBM), splits are optimized using gradients and Hessians, which helps efficiently find good thresholds without exhaustively checking all unique values.

### **Balancing Precision and Efficiency**
The choice of strategy depends on the dataset and the algorithm's requirements:
- **High Precision Needs:** Use midpoints or quantile-based thresholds.
- **Scalability Needs:** Use binning or random sampling.

### **Conclusion**
While using all unique values is theoretically optimal, it is often unnecessary in practice. Efficient methods like midpoints, binning, or sampling can reduce computation time significantly while still yielding high-quality splits. These techniques are particularly important in large-scale machine learning tasks, where performance and scalability are critical.
