### **Overview of LLM Tasks**

Here’s a breakdown of each task, including what it is, where it’s useful, and how it's approached:

---

### **1. Token Classification**

#### **What It Is:**
Token classification involves assigning a label to each token in a sequence. It’s often used for tasks like:
- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Identifying entities like names, dates, or locations.
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging**: Classifying tokens as nouns, verbs, adjectives, etc.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Extracting structured information from text (e.g., extracting names from a legal document).
- Linguistic analysis (e.g., identifying grammatical structures).
- Medical text annotation (e.g., labeling diseases or symptoms).

#### **How It’s Done:**
1. **Model Selection**: Use a pre-trained transformer model (e.g., BERT, RoBERTa).
2. **Dataset**: Input text is tokenized, and each token is paired with a label.
   - Example: `"John lives in New York"` → Tokens: `["John", "lives", "in", "New", "York"]`
   - Labels: `[PER, O, O, LOC, LOC]` (PER = person, LOC = location, O = other).
3. **Fine-Tuning**:
   - Add a classification head (linear layer) on top of the model’s outputs.
   - Train the model on the labeled dataset.

#### **Evaluation Metrics:**
- **Accuracy**: Percentage of correct token predictions.
- **F1 Score**: Balances precision and recall, especially important for imbalanced datasets.

### **2. Fine-Tuning a Masked Language Model (MLM)**

#### **What It Is:**
A masked language model predicts missing words in a sentence. Fine-tuning MLMs adapts them to specific domains or tasks by training on a smaller, task-specific dataset.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Domain-specific tasks (e.g., adapting a general model to medical or legal text).
- Improving performance in languages or dialects underrepresented in the original model.

#### **How It’s Done:**
1. **Pre-Trained Model**: Start with a masked model (e.g., BERT, DistilBERT).
2. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Input: Mask random tokens in the text with a special `[MASK]` token.
   - Target: The model predicts the original masked tokens.
   - Example: `"The cat is on the [MASK]."` → Target: `mat`.
3. **Fine-Tuning**:
   - Use domain-specific or task-specific datasets.
   - Train the model to predict the masked tokens by minimizing cross-entropy loss.
4. **Applications**:
   - Fine-tuning improves domain adaptation and task performance (e.g., biomedical BERT).

#### **Evaluation Metrics:**
- Perplexity (how well the model predicts sequences).
  - Note that a perplexity score of 10 means that the model is selecting 
    10 equally likely options for the masked word
  - A lower perplexity score generally means a better model
- Token-level accuracy for the masked tokens.

### **3. Translation**

#### **What It Is:**
Translation involves converting text from one language to another. LLMs trained for this task are called *seq-to-seq* models (sequence-to-sequence).

#### **Use Cases:**
- Real-time language translation (e.g., apps like Google Translate).
- Multilingual applications in customer service or content generation.
- Translating low-resource languages with transfer learning.

#### **How It’s Done:**
1. **Pre-Trained Models**: Use models like T5, mBART, or GPT trained on multilingual datasets.
2. **Training**:
   - Input: Sentence in source language.
   - Target: Sentence in the target language.
   - Example: `"Bonjour"` → `"Hello"`.
3. **Fine-Tuning**:
   - Fine-tune pre-trained models using parallel corpora (datasets with aligned translations).
4. **Inference**:
   - Decode outputs using beam search or greedy decoding for fluent translations.

#### **Evaluation Metrics:**
- **BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy)**: Measures overlap between model and reference translations.
- **METEOR**: Accounts for synonyms and linguistic variations.
- **ROUGE**: Common in summarization but applicable to translation for overlap in n-grams.

### **4. Summarization**

#### **What It Is:**
Summarization condenses a larger text into a shorter, coherent version while retaining the main idea. There are two types:
- **Extractive Summarization**: Selects key sentences or phrases directly from the text.
- **Abstractive Summarization**: Generates new sentences to summarize the text, similar to human writing.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Summarizing articles, legal documents, or research papers.
- Creating executive summaries in business settings.
- Generating concise content for news or social media.

#### **How It’s Done:**
1. **Pre-Trained Models**: Use seq-to-seq models like T5, BART, or Pegasus.
2. **Dataset**:
   - Input: Long-form text.
   - Target: Shortened summary.
   - Example: Text: `"The stock market saw a rise in tech shares due to investor optimism."` → Summary: `"Tech shares rose on investor optimism."`
3. **Training**:
   - Fine-tune the model on labeled datasets (e.g., CNN/Daily Mail for news summarization).
4. **Decoding**:
   - Use beam search or nucleus sampling to generate high-quality summaries.

#### **Evaluation Metrics:**
- **ROUGE**: Measures n-gram overlap between generated summaries and reference summaries.
- **Human Evaluation**: For coherence, fluency, and informativeness.

### **Common Techniques Across Tasks**
- Use pre-trained LLMs like BERT, T5, or GPT to reduce training time.
- Fine-tune with task-specific datasets.
- Optimize hyperparameters for the specific task (learning rate, batch size, etc.).
- Regularize to prevent overfitting, especially with small datasets.
